# Elevate Labs - Cybersecurity Internship

This repository serves as a portfolio of my work and completed tasks for the Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship. Each task is organized in its own dedicated directory, named `day1`, `day2`, `day3`, and so on.

The main objective of this repository is to document my progress, showcase the skills I've learned, and provide a clear, organized record of my work throughout the internship program.

### Repository Structure

* `Day1/`: Contains all files and reports related to Task 1: "Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports."
* `Day2/`: Reserved for Task 2.
* `Day3/`: Reserved for Task 3.
* ...and so on for subsequent tasks.

You can view a clean, organized list of all completed tasks and their corresponding reports by opening the `index.html` file in this repository.
