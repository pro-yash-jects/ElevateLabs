\## Phishing Email Analysis



This repository contains the deliverables for Task 2 of the Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship. The objective of this task was to identify and analyze the characteristics of a phishing email sample.



\### Files Included



\* `phishing\_report.html`: This HTML file contains the full report of the phishing email analysis, including a simulated email sample and a breakdown of the phishing indicators found.

\* `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the task and the contents of the repository.



\### Analysis Process



My approach to analyzing the suspicious email sample included the following steps:



\* \*\*Obtained a Sample:\*\* A sample phishing email was obtained.

\* \*\*Analyzed Sender and Headers:\*\* The sender's email address was examined for spoofing, and the email headers were checked for discrepancies using an online header analyzer.

\* \*\*Identified Suspicious Links:\*\* Suspicious links or attachments were identified by hovering over them to reveal the actual, often mismatched, URLs.

\* \*\*Assessed Language and Tone:\*\* I identified urgent or threatening language in the email body, which is a common phishing tactic.

\* \*\*Checked for Errors:\*\* The email was verified for the presence of spelling or grammar errors, another common indicator of a phishing attempt.

\* \*\*Summarized Findings:\*\* All identified phishing traits were summarized in the final report.



\### Outcome



The outcome of this task is a practical understanding of common phishing tactics and the development of skills in email threat analysis.
