    <h2>Phishing Indicators Found</h2>
    <p>A detailed analysis reveals several key indicators of a phishing attempt, as outlined in the task hints.</p>
    <ul class="indicator-list">
        <li>
            <h3>Sender's Email Address for Spoofing</h3>
            <p>The email is sent from <code>security.alerts@wellsfargo-update.net</code>. This is a clear case of email spoofing and domain impersonation. While it includes the company name "wellsfargo," the domain is <code>wellsfargo-update.net</code>, not the legitimate <code>wellsfargo.com</code>. This is designed to deceive the recipient into believing the email is from a trusted source.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Suspicious Links</h3>
            <p>The link provided, <code>http://wellsfargo.com.security-verify.pw/login.php</code>, is suspicious. Although the text says "wellsfargo.com," the actual top-level domain is <code>.pw</code>, and the hostname is <code>security-verify.pw</code>. The use of "wellsfargo.com" as a subdomain is a common tactic to trick users. Hovering over the link reveals this discrepancy, which is a major red flag.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Urgent or Threatening Language</h3>
            <p>The email uses strong, urgent language to pressure the recipient into acting without thinking. Phrases like "Urgent Security Alert," "Your Account is Suspended," and "Failure to act within 24 hours will result in the permanent closure of your account" are examples of social engineering. This tactic aims to create fear and bypass the recipient's critical judgment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Spelling and Grammar Errors</h3>
            <p>The email contains a grammatical error: "We apologize for any inconvenience this may have cause." The correct word should be "caused." The generic salutation "Dear Valued Wells Fargo Customer" instead of a personalized name is also a common indicator of a phishing attempt, as legitimate companies often use the user's name.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion and Recommended Actions</h2>
    <p>This email is a clear phishing attempt designed to steal credentials. The indicators found include a spoofed sender address, deceptive links, a sense of urgency, and grammatical errors. The user should not click the link or reply to the email. The appropriate action would be to delete the email or report it to the IT or security department. This awareness of phishing tactics is crucial for effective threat analysis.</p>
